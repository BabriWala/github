> As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.

> Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.

> For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment:

    git add index.html

    git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
        new file: index.html

>
    git add --all

>Note: The shorthand command for git add --all is git add -A
